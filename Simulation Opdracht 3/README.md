# Disease Model simulation

This model simulates the spread of disease among an N amount of agents within a static enviroment.

<b>Note:</b> This model uses MESA libraries and I therefore recommend installing the mesa library first!

To start the model run the 'disease_run.py' file. \
Tutorial I followed: included in the PDF.
